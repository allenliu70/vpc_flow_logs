Field	Description	Version
version

The VPC Flow Logs version. If you use the default format, the version is 2. If you use a custom format, the version is the highest version among the specified fields. For example, if you specify only fields from version 2, the version is 2. If you specify a mixture of fields from versions 2, 3, and 4, the version is 4.

Parquet data type: INT_32

2
account-id

The AWS account ID of the owner of the source network interface for which traffic is recorded. If the network interface is created by an AWS service, for example when creating a VPC endpoint or Network Load Balancer, the record might display unknown for this field.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
interface-id

The ID of the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
srcaddr

The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic on the network interface. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address. See also pkt-srcaddr.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
dstaddr

The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic on the network interface. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address. See also pkt-dstaddr.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
srcport

The source port of the traffic.

Parquet data type: INT_32

2
dstport

The destination port of the traffic.

Parquet data type: INT_32

2
protocol

The IANA protocol number of the traffic. For more information, see Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers.

Parquet data type: INT_32

2
packets

The number of packets transferred during the flow.

Parquet data type: INT_64

2
bytes

The number of bytes transferred during the flow.

Parquet data type: INT_64

2
start

The time, in Unix seconds, when the first packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface.

Parquet data type: INT_64

2
end

The time, in Unix seconds, when the last packet of the flow was received within the aggregation interval. This might be up to 60 seconds after the packet was transmitted or received on the network interface.

Parquet data type: INT_64

2
action

The action that is associated with the traffic:

ACCEPT — The traffic was accepted.

REJECT — The traffic was rejected. For example, the traffic was not allowed by the security groups or network ACLs, or packets arrived after the connection was closed.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
log-status

The logging status of the flow log:

OK — Data is logging normally to the chosen destinations.

NODATA — There was no network traffic to or from the network interface during the aggregation interval.

SKIPDATA — Some flow log records were skipped during the aggregation interval. This might be because of an internal capacity constraint, or an internal error.

Some flow log records may be skipped during the aggregation interval (see log-status in Available fields). This may be caused by an internal AWS capacity constraint or internal error. If you are using AWS Cost Explorer to view VPC flow log charges and some flow logs are skipped during the flow log aggregation interval, the number of flow logs reported in AWS Cost Explorer will be higher than the number of flow logs published by Amazon VPC.

Parquet data type: STRING

2
vpc-id

The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.

Parquet data type: STRING

3
subnet-id

The ID of the subnet that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.

Parquet data type: STRING

3
instance-id

The ID of the instance that's associated with network interface for which the traffic is recorded, if the instance is owned by you. Returns a '-' symbol for a requester-managed network interface; for example, the network interface for a NAT gateway.

Parquet data type: STRING

3
tcp-flags

The bitmask value for the following TCP flags:

FIN — 1

SYN — 2

RST — 4

SYN-ACK — 18

If no supported flags are recorded, the TCP flag value is 0. For example, since tcp-flags does not support logging ACK or PSH flags, records for traffic with these unsupported flags will result in tcp-flags value 0. If, however, an unsupported flag is accompanied by a supported flag, we will report the value of the supported flag. For example, if ACK is a part of SYN-ACK, it reports 18. And if there is a record like SYN+ECE, since SYN is a supported flag and ECE is not, the TCP flag value is 2. If for some reason the flag combination is invalid and the value cannot be calculated, the value is '-'. If no flags are sent, the TCP flag value is 0.
TCP flags can be OR-ed during the aggregation interval. For short connections, the flags might be set on the same line in the flow log record, for example, 19 for SYN-ACK and FIN, and 3 for SYN and FIN. For an example, see TCP flag sequence.

For general information about TCP flags (such as the meaning of flags like FIN, SYN, and ACK), see TCP segment structure on Wikipedia.

The type of traffic. The possible values are: IPv4 | IPv6 | EFA. For more information, see Elastic Fabric Adapter.

Parquet data type: STRING

3
pkt-srcaddr

The packet-level (original) source IP address of the traffic. Use this field with the srcaddr field to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer through which traffic flows, and the original source IP address of the traffic. For example, when traffic flows through a network interface for a NAT gateway, or where the IP address of a pod in Amazon EKS is different from the IP address of the network interface of the instance node on which the pod is running (for communication within a VPC).

Parquet data type: STRING

3
pkt-dstaddr

The packet-level (original) destination IP address for the traffic. Use this field with the dstaddr field to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer through which traffic flows, and the final destination IP address of the traffic. For example, when traffic flows through a network interface for a NAT gateway, or where the IP address of a pod in Amazon EKS is different from the IP address of the network interface of the instance node on which the pod is running (for communication within a VPC).
